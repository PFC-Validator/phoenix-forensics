## Scope, limits, and notes

Supplemental records only; earlier aggregate datasets are not incremented. Transfers, fee-share annotations, unknown units and unquantified events remain distinct. Findings are bounded by their explicit limits. No identity attribution added.

This sidecar records provenance only. It does not independently validate every assertion in the artifact.
